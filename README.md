This project focuses on predicting crop production using machine learning, specifically the Random Forest Regressor, after testing models like Linear Regression and XGBoost. The dataset includes factors like area harvested, yield, and year to analyze trends and improve agricultural decision-making. Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn are used for data processing and model training, while Matplotlib and Seaborn help with visualization. The insights from this project can help optimize resource allocation, improve productivity, and support sustainable agriculture by forecasting future crop yields.
